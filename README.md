Thank you for looking at BitNotes, the autosaving text editor.

BitNotes autosaves text files as a 16 bit long hexadecimal number as the file name 
along with 20+ other file types natively to your desktop

To install and run the program properly, simply click [here for the Windows Version of BitNotes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/18kwhjqwar3rmr3/BitNotes.jar?dl=0) and click [here for the Mac version of BitNotes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/20g7naswrhrovpw/BitNotes.jar?dl=0).

If you run the Mac version on Windows or the Windows version on mac, the program will not be able
to save files.

This program was made with JDK 1.8.0_51 and JRE 1.8.0_51
