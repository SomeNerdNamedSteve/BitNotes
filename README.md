Thank you for looking at BitNotes, the autosaving text editor.

BitNotes autosaves text files as a 16 bit long hexadecimal number as the file name 
along with 20+ other file types natively to your desktop

To run the program properly, simply click on the .jar files in the folder for your operating system 
(i.e. click on the "BitNotes.jar" file in the Mac folder to run this program on a computer with Mac OSX
or the  "BitNotes.jar" file in the Windows file to run this program on a Windows machine).

If you run the Mac version on Windows or the Windows version on mac, the program will not be able
to save files.

This program was made with JDK 1.8.0_51 and JRE 1.8.0_51
